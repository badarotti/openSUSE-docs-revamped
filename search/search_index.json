You are in the right place. This is a young project that aims to provide a user friendly guide for quickly installing and setting up openSUSE with minimum fuss. For New Users \u2693\ufe0e The documentation is layed out in a user friendly manner. You will find that it caters for beginners or new-to-Linux users and will gets you and running quickly. Installing Linux can seem daunting since it has a lot of new concepts, many choices and tons of options. Choice is good, but it can be overwelming or confusing for new users. Initially, the installation instruction will cover only the necessary options and configuration choices to help you quickly setup a running system suitable with sane defaults suitable for daily use. With the system running and productive you can lean at your leisue how to perform different routine system tasks such as installing apps, adjusting the system settings or custmizing openSUSE. And, if you're so inclined, start honing your Linux-foo skills. For experienced Users \u2693\ufe0e For the experienced Linux user the documentation includes short pointers on how things are done in openSUSE and what's different about it. Links to advanced topic in this site or elswere will get you aquainted with the system and up and running quickly. Documentation Sections \u2693\ufe0e Pre-Install \u2693\ufe0e We will make it easy to install openSUSE. Here you will learn what you need to know to get a system running. This can be the absolute minimum and go with the defaults, or you can make a few choices. For example you can choose a Desktop Environment. What is a Desktop Environment? you'll find out in this section if you want to make that choice. Experienced users will learn about what differentiates openSUSE from other distros and get to know it's unique features to make informed choises during the install process. For example you can find about the power of snapshots using Btrfs as well as other advanced distros featuring atomic transactional updates and about distros designed to run container loads. Install \u2693\ufe0e Now that you have a plan, this section will walk you step by step preparing your installation media and will walk you during the installation. All of this depending on choice you made pre-install. Experienced user will find a quick info cheet on notable installation options and procedures for reference. At this stage and with minimum fuss you will have a running system with sane defaults that is ready for daily use. From here you can move forward at your leisure, or when you need to. OS Orientation \u2693\ufe0e Here you will find several walk-though for the different features of Linux in general and openSUSE in paticular. You will become familiar with the user interface, system settings, installing and upgrading software and general good computing practices. You will also learn how the use the unique openSUSE features like YaST and snapshots. After Install Setup \u2693\ufe0e In this section you will find setup information for devices you might or might not have. This could be a printer, scanner or a dedicated grapic card. You will also find information on how to install software that you cannot find in the official openSUSE software repositories. Advanced Install \u2693\ufe0e If you are an experienced user you might want to setup your system in a particular way to take advantage of the latest Linux technologies. In this section you will find information on how to setup openSUSE with these technologies. Topics covered include advanced partitioning schemes, encryption, display servers, vulnerability mitigation, etc. Advanced Topics \u2693\ufe0e Now that you're familiar with Linux and openSUSE, you might want to get the most out of it. In this section you'll find information on how to take full advantage of the Linux and openSUSE tools like YaST, Zypper, Snapper, etc. Other Documentation \u2693\ufe0e In this section you will have reference documentation and guides suitable for corporate users and system administrators in various formats (HTML, PDF and EPUB)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Are you looking for sane Linux documentation?

Git is a command line interface program and it has a number of GUI interfaces. If you are new to Git or new to the command line we recommend using the Atom text editor. It's a beautiful and capable editor with a great GUI for Git and GitHub. Note that there's a difference between Git and GitHub. Git is the Version Control System application that you run locally on your computer. It handles the source of the documentation that we write. It controls the main document base as well as your modifications; and merges your modifications with document base while keeping track of every change.

Both are openSUSE operating systems but they are targeted for different uses/users. openSUSE Leap \u2693\ufe0e This is recommended distribution if you are a new user or you want a stable/production system. It is easy to use and will run with little maintenance or problems. During the lifetime of your install of openSUSE Leap version, you will receive security updates for all included packages as well as critical bug fixes. A new minor release (15.0, 15.1, 15.2, etc.) is expected approximately every 12 months aligned with SUSE Linux Enterprise Service Pack (The commercial big brother of openSUSE). A major release (15.0, 16.0, etc.) is expected approximately 36 to 48 months from the initial major release. This is also aligned with SUSE Linux Enterprise Releases With Leap you have to explicitly instruct the operating system to upgrade to the latest minor or major releases. This will give you the opportunity to upgrade when you are ready and you have a proper tested back up. openSUSE Tumbleweed \u2693\ufe0e This distribution is for the experienced Linux User. It is a rolling release that is constantly updated and always at the 'latest release'. Every update you perform will be a complete system upgrade. It receives security updates, bug fixes and new features (most often as new software versions) as soon as they are integrated and tested by the openSUSE community. Critical security updates for packages may also be provided in situations where new software versions may not yet address major security issues. Due to it's nature of being on the cutting edge, Tumbleweed updates tend to be frequent and big in size. If you have limited network connectivity Tumbleweed might be challenging to maintain. Although the allure of having the latest software releases may be attractive to you, be sure to understand that using and maintaining Tumbleweed requires using the command line (for example regular system updates) and that sometimes upgrades cause problems that might frustrate you if you're not an experienced Linux user. Don't let this detract you from using Tumbleweed in any way, If you are an experienced user with CLI knowledge and prefer the cutting edge of a rolling release, you will love Tumbleweed. It's well tested, stable and it's problems are minimal. References \u2693\ufe0e An openSUSE wiki page on the lifetime cycles of Leap and Tumbleweed .
